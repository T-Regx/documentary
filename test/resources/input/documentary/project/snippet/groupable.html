<p>
    Interface representing a match (a result of `preg_match()` or `preg_match_all()` method),
    that can be used to confidently assert a capturing group existence.
</p>
<p>With result of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        `preg_match()` (`IRawMatch`) - it's not possible (because a group can be either missing, or trimmed
        by `preg_match()`). That's why `preg_match()` is used only for `match()->first()` without a callback.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>With results of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>`preg_match(PREG_UNMATCHED_AS_NULL)` - `IRawMatchNullable`</li>
    <li>`preg_match(PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE)` - `IRawMatchOffset`</li>
    <li>`preg_match_all()` - `IRawMatches`</li>
</ul>
<p>...it is possible to assert a capturing group existence - a lack of such group in the results necessarily means
    that the group is missing.</p>
